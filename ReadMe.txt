Here`s to the crazy ones,The misfits,the rebels,the trouble makers,the round pegs in the square holes.The ones who see things differently.They are not fond of rules.And the have no respect for the status quo.You can quote them,disgree with them,glorify or vilify them.About the only thing you can`t do,is ingore them.Because they change the things.They push the human face forward.And while some may see them as the crazy ones,we see genius,Because the people who are crazy enough,to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
